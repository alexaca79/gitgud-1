## What is git

Git is a version control system used to track changes on files on your computer. It is most widely used for managing and maintaining source code for software. It was built by the all mighty Linus Torvalds, he built git because it was getting too difficult to maintain the Linux project.

But this base model is where we will start.

## Let's start

Soooo, lets start playing around with some shell commands. At this point I am assuming you have git install on your machine. We are going to use git on the terminal, sorry no GUI application. If you on OSX it should be installed.
